# Prompt Engineering Handbook 📖

## Spam this 3 times so it gets in queue:
```md
Are you sure all work is complete? 
Be brutally honest. 
If any part is missing, unclear, or could be parallelized better 
— create more subagents right now and delegate.
```

## Put this after:
```md
When done, 
with fresh eyes, 
review your changes with 2 subagents, 
fix any issues, 
then repeat until no issues found.
```
